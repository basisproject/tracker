## Roadmap

The Basis project roadmap has recently shifted quite a bit and the project is now in a phase
of active restructuring in various aspects. For one, much of the logic [is being moved to the
Basis core](https://github.com/basisproject/core) which makes Basis much more nimble and
portable.

Secondly, the regional aspects of Basis are [undergoing a death and rebirth](https://basisproject.net/posts/2020/07/rethinking-regions-and-companies/) which changes a lot of the
project's dynamics.

Third, moving forward, Basis is going to be democracy first. In previous versions, there was
the concept of an admin or superuser account that set things up initially and allowed users
of the system to interact from there. In the upcoming versions of Basis, we will consider
building the network from the first user to the billionth user without the concept of admins.
Basis will be a self-managed system.

The [Basis paper](https://github.com/basisproject/paper) is a living document and is currently
subject to a number of [pending changes](https://github.com/basisproject/tracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproject%3Apaper) that will affect the final outcome based on discussions and
input from lovely people like you.

As such, the project roadmap cannot be quantified at the moment like it was previously, and
it's better to look through the [list of issues](https://github.com/basisproject/tracker/issues)
to get a sense of where the project is going.

## Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help out!

At the moment, Basis is very focused on theory (both in relation to economics, property, and
practical application of both) and less so focused on code. If you do have coding experience,
great. Feel free to [look through issues relating to the core](https://github.com/basisproject/tracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproject%3Acore)
to see where you can help out. Otherwise, pick a [discussion item](https://github.com/basisproject/tracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atype%3Adiscussion+)
that interests you and get involved!
